# Exercise 1:
 Write a program for a package delivery service. The program contains an array that holds the 
ten zip codes to which the company delivers packages. Prompt a user to enter a zip code and 
display a message indicating whether the zip code is one to which the company delivers.

# Exercise 2:
Write a program that allows a teacher to enter in a N-number of students. For each student 
ask the teacher to enter in their name and final score for the class. When the teacher is done 
entering the data, print the highest grade in the class, and the average grade for the class.

# Exercise 3:
 Create a game like Hangman in which a player guesses letters to try to replicate a hidden 
word. Store at least eight words in an array, and randomly select one to be the hidden word. 
Initially, display the hidden word using asterisks to represent each letter. Allow the user to 
guess letters to replace the asterisks in the hidden word until the user completes the entire 
word. If the user guesses a letter that is not in the hidden word, display an appropriate 
message. If the user guesses a letter that appears multiple times in the hidden word, make 
sure that each correct letter is placed.
